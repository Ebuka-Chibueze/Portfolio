					instead of guessing a letter, you'll answer a trivia question. If <br>
					your answer is correct, you'll unlock a random letter of the passage.<br>
					If not, then parts of the stick man will be drawn. Like the original Hangman game, <br>
					you'll be given an option to solve the whole piece, in which case you'll <br>
					be given a prompt to type your answer. If you solved the whole passage, <br>
					then you've won the whole game. If not then the game continues with a part <br>
					of the stick man being drawn.

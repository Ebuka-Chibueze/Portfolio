/**Welcome to Trivial Hangman**/ 

This game requires data from the ".txt" files
in the folder "_txt". There are four files used in the game:

1. "Questions.txt"
2. "Answers.txt"
3. "Options.txt"
4. "Passage.txt"

Within each of these files, if you want to separate questions, answers, options,
& passages, put a "." in between so the computer knows where to separate text.

Note: 1. It is only "Questions.txt" that you don't put a "." at the very
	last question, but it's critical to do it in all the other ".txt" files.

      2. If the game doesn't launch well in Chrome, launch in Firefox or Internet
	Explorer.

      3. Don’t add the “’” or any special characters in any “.txt” files as it brings up another value other than the intended.
	Instead, joined the letters together. e.g "don't" into "dont"
